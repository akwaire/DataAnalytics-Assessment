-- Q3: Account Inactivity Alert
-- Goal: Identify savings or investment plans with no inflow in the last 365 days (or never used).

-- ========================================================================
-- Step 1: Compute each planâ€™s most recent inflow date
-- ========================================================================

    FROM savings_savingsaccount
    -- no WHERE needed since MAX(NULL) is ignored
    GROUP BY savings_id                           -- one row per plan
)

-- ========================================================================
-- Step 2: Join plans to their last inflow info and filter for inactivity
-- ========================================================================
