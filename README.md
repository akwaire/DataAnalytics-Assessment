## ‚úÖ Q1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

### üîç Scenario  
The business wants to identify customers who have **both a savings and an investment plan** ‚Äî for cross-selling opportunities.

### üß© Task  
Return users who have:
- At least one **funded savings plan** (`is_regular_savings = 1`)
- At least one **investment plan** (`is_a_fund = 1`)
- Total **confirmed deposits** (converted from kobo to naira)

Sort results in **descending order** of total deposits.

### üìä Tables Used
- `users_customuser`
- `plans_plan`
- `savings_savingsaccount`

---

### üß† SQL Strategy

This solution uses **modular SQL with CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for clarity and reusability:

1. **`user_plans`** ‚Äì counts savings and investment plans per user  
2. **`user_deposits`** ‚Äì aggregates confirmed deposit amounts  
3. **Final SELECT** ‚Äì joins everything, applies filters, and sorts

### üìå SQL Concepts Applied

| Concept           | Description                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `WITH` (CTEs)    | Modular, reusable logic blocks                    |
| `CASE WHEN`      | Conditional plan counts                           |
| `COALESCE`       | Converts `NULL` to `0` for cleaner output         |
| `ROUND(..., 2)`  | Converts from kobo to naira with 2 decimal places |
| `LEFT JOIN`      | Ensures users without deposits are still included |

---

### üöÄ Performance

- Benchmarked on a local machine:
  - ~1,760 users
  - 159K+ savings records
  - 9.6K+ plans
- **Full query execution time: 1 second**
- Fully scalable and readable for real-world analytics

### üì• Result Sample (Top 2 Users)

| owner_id                             | name   | savings_count | investment_count | total_deposits   |
|--------------------------------------|--------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1909df3eba2548cfa3b9c270112bd262     | (NULL) | 3              | 9                | 890312215.48     |

## ‚úÖ Q2: Transaction Frequency Analysis

### üîç Scenario  
The finance team wants to understand how often customers transact, in order to segment them into frequency-based cohorts for personalized targeting or product design.

### üß© Task  
Group users into frequency segments by calculating their **average transactions per month**, based on records in `savings_savingsaccount`.

**Categories:**
- **High Frequency**: ‚â• 10 txns/month  
- **Medium Frequency**: 3‚Äì9 txns/month  
- **Low Frequency**: ‚â§ 2 txns/month

Return a summary report showing:
- `frequency_category`
- `customer_count`
- `avg_transactions_per_month`

---

### üß† SQL Strategy

This query was structured using **modular CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for clarity, flexibility, and performance:

1. **`user_monthly_stats`**  
   - Aggregates `total_transactions` and `distinct months` per user  
   - Calculates `avg_txn_per_month`

2. **`categorized_users`**  
   - Buckets each user into High/Medium/Low frequency based on average

3. **Final SELECT**  
   - Aggregates number of users per frequency group  
   - Computes average frequency per group

| `DATE_FORMAT(..., '%Y-%m')` | Normalize timestamps to month granularity                  |
| `CASE WHEN`                 | Used for frequency bucket classification                   |
| `ROUND()`                   | For cleaner average output                                 |
| `FIELD()` in `ORDER BY`     | Preserves semantic order of frequency labels               |

### üß™ Performance

- Query completed in **1 second**
- Dataset size: ~159K+ transactions
- Scalable due to well-structured aggregation and conditional logic

## ‚úÖ Q3: Account Inactivity Alert

### üîç Scenario  
The ops team wants to flag plans (savings or investment) that have **no inflow transactions** for over one year.

### üß© Task  
Find all active plans where:
- No transactions in the past 365 days  
- Includes plans that have **never been used**

Return:
- `plan_id`
- `owner_id`
- `type` (‚ÄúSavings‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù)
- `last_transaction_date`
- `inactivity_days`

---

### üß† SQL Strategy

This query uses **modular CTEs** to separate concerns:

1. **`last_transaction`**  
   - Aggregates the **most recent** `transaction_date` per plan.

2. **Final SELECT**  
   - Joins each plan to its last transaction  
   - Filters for plans with `last_transaction_date IS NULL` or inactivity > 365 days  
   - Calculates `inactivity_days` via `DATEDIFF(NOW(), last_transaction_date)`

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `WITH` (CTE)       | Isolates ‚Äúmost recent inflow‚Äù logic                   |
| `MAX()`            | Finds the latest transaction per plan                 |
| `LEFT JOIN`        | Includes plans with no matching transactions          |
| `CASE WHEN`        | Classifies each plan as ‚ÄúSavings‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù     |
| `DATEDIFF()`       | Computes days since the last inflow                   |

---

### üß™ Performance

- Query runtime: **2.7 seconds**  
- Dataset: ~9.6K plans, ~163K transactions  
- Scalable with proper indexing on `(savings_id, transaction_date)`

## ‚úÖ Q4: Customer Lifetime Value Estimation

### üîç Scenario

Marketing wants to estimate customer lifetime value (CLV) from tenure and transaction volume, using a simple profit margin.

### üß© Task

For each customer:

1. **Tenure** (months since `date_joined`, minimum 1)
2. **Total transactions** in `savings_savingsaccount`
3. **Estimated profit per transaction** = 0.1% of transaction value
4. **CLV** = (total\_transactions / tenure) √ó 12 √ó avg\_profit
5. Sort by **estimated\_clv** descending

---

### üß† SQL Strategy

```sql
WITH user_stats AS (
    SELECT
        u.id                     AS customer_id,
        u.name                   AS name,
        GREATEST(
          TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, u.date_joined, NOW()),
          1
        )                       AS tenure_months,
        COUNT(s.id)             AS total_transactions,
        AVG(s.confirmed_amount) AS avg_amount_kobo
    FROM users_customuser u
    LEFT JOIN savings_savingsaccount s
      ON s.owner_id = u.id
    GROUP BY u.id, u.name
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    name,
    tenure_months,
    total_transactions,
    ROUND(
      (total_transactions / tenure_months) * 12
      * (avg_amount_kobo / 100000),
      2
    )                       AS estimated_clv
FROM user_stats
ORDER BY estimated_clv DESC;
```
